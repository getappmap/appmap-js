This AppMap shows the execution flow of a test report generation feature, specifically for handling failed tests. Here are the key observations:

## What it captures
- **Test**: "failedTests with a failure header reports 1 failed" - a unit test that verifies proper reporting of test failures
- **Main flow**: Generation of a report section for failed tests, including heading and formatting

## Notable execution pattern
The trace shows a clean, hierarchical execution:

1. **`generateHeading()`** - Main entry point that orchestrates the heading generation
2. **`buildContext()`** - Prepares the data context (test failures)
3. **`helpers()`** - Retrieves template helper functions
4. **`length()`** - Counts the number of failed tests (returns 1)
5. **`section_link()`** - Generates a markdown link with the format `[Failed tests](#failed-tests)`

## Key details
- The system is processing **1 test failure** from `spec/controllers/users_controller_test.rb:10`
- The failure involves an unexpected HTTP response: expected a redirect (3XX) but got OK (200)
- The final output is a formatted table row: `| [Failed tests](#failed-tests) | :warning: 1 failed |`

## What's particularly noteworthy
This AppMap demonstrates a well-structured template-based reporting system that transforms test failure data into user-friendly markdown output. The execution is efficient (sub-millisecond timing) and follows a clear separation of concerns between data preparation, helper functions, and formatting.
