This AppMap shows the execution of an OpenAPI command that processes AppMap files to generate OpenAPI specifications. Here are the key aspects:

## What it does
The AppMap traces the `OpenAPI accepts an absolute --appmap-dir path` test, which:
1. **Discovers AppMap files** in `/home/divide/projects/appmap-js/packages/cli/tests/unit/fixtures/ruby/`
2. **Processes two AppMap files**:
   - `revoke_api_key.appmap.json` 
   - `user_page_scenario.appmap.json`
3. **Generates OpenAPI specifications** from HTTP server requests found in those AppMaps

## Notable patterns
- **HTTP endpoint analysis**: The system extracts HTTP requests and responses to build OpenAPI specs:
  - `DELETE /api/api_keys` (with 200 and 401 responses)
  - `GET /organizations/new` (with 200 response)
- **Temporary file management**: Uses `/tmp/appmap-openapi-sEI2kH/` for intermediate data storage
- **Request grouping**: Groups related HTTP calls by path to build comprehensive endpoint documentation

## Particularly interesting aspects
1. **Multi-status handling**: The `/api/api_keys` endpoint shows both successful (200) and unauthorized (401) responses, demonstrating how the tool captures different execution paths
2. **Clean architecture**: Clear separation between data collection (`DataStore`), processing (`parseHTTPServerRequests`), and output generation (`DefinitionGenerator`)
3. **Comprehensive metadata extraction**: Captures request/response headers, content types, parameters, and status codes for complete API documentation

This is a good example of how AppMap can be used for **automated API documentation generation** by analyzing actual application behavior rather than static code analysis.
