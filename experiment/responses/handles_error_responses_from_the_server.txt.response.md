This AppMap shows a test case for error handling in a Zendesk integration. Here are the key points:

## Test Overview
- **Test**: "Zendesk handles error responses from the server"
- **Status**: Succeeded (the test passed)
- **Framework**: Jest running on Node.js v23.9.0

## What's Happening
The test verifies that the `zendesk.createRequest()` function properly handles server errors by:

1. **Making a request** to create a Zendesk ticket with test data
2. **Receiving a 400 Bad Request** response from the server
3. **Throwing an HttpError** with the message "Failed to create a Zendesk Request"

## Notable Aspects

**Error Handling Pattern**: The code follows a good practice of wrapping HTTP errors in custom exception types (`HttpError`) rather than letting raw HTTP responses bubble up.

**Test Environment**: The test uses a local mock server (`http://localhost:41443`) rather than hitting the actual Zendesk API, which is appropriate for unit testing.

**Response Structure**: The server returns a structured error response (`{"error":"Bad request"}`) that gets captured in the HttpError for debugging purposes.

This AppMap demonstrates that your error handling is working correctly - the function properly converts a 400 HTTP response into a meaningful application-level exception that can be caught and handled by calling code.
