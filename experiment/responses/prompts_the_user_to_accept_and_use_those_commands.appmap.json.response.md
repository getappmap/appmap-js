This AppMap shows the execution flow of a test case that validates how the AppMap CLI handles pre-configured test commands. Here are the key aspects:

## What it does
The code checks if test commands are already configured in the AppMap configuration and prompts the user about using them. Specifically, it:

1. **Sets up a test command**: Configures `'bundle exec rails test'` as a test command in the configuration
2. **Checks configuration**: Calls `areTestCasesConfigured()` to verify if test commands exist
3. **Retrieves the commands**: Uses `configOption()` to get the configured test commands
4. **Displays to user**: Shows progress messages informing the user about the configured commands

## Notable aspects

**Configuration Management**: The code uses a sophisticated configuration system with:
- `TempConfig` class for managing temporary configuration state
- Nested configuration paths like `'test_recording.test_commands'`
- Merge operations to combine configuration data

**User Interaction Pattern**: The code follows a clear UX pattern:
- Informs user that commands were found in configuration
- Shows the actual command (`bundle exec rails test`)
- Uses a spinner-based progress interface

**Test Context**: This is from a Jest test (`test_status: "succeeded"`) that validates the behavior when test commands are pre-configured, which is important for ensuring the CLI handles existing configurations gracefully.

The AppMap captures a complete user workflow scenario, making it valuable for understanding how the CLI's configuration discovery and user prompting system works in practice.
