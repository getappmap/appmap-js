This AppMap shows the execution flow of a test case for the "removed AppMaps" functionality in what appears to be an AppMap CLI tool's compare-report feature.

## Key observations:

**Test Context**: This is a unit test (`removedAppMaps.spec.ts`) that verifies the behavior when AppMaps are removed between revisions, specifically testing that "details are provided" for removed AppMaps.

**Core Functionality**: The trace shows the generation of a report section for removed AppMaps, which:
1. Creates a `RemovedAppMapsPreprocessor` to handle the removed AppMap data
2. Builds context and helpers for template rendering
3. Generates a markdown report with links to the removed AppMap

**Interesting Details**:
- The test uses a mock AppMap with ID `minitest/users_controller_test` but the recorder is actually `rspec` (not minitest)
- The final output is a markdown section with an emoji header "✖️ Removed AppMaps" and a link to view the AppMap on getappmap.com
- The URL generation includes proper encoding for the AppMap path

**Notable Pattern**: The code follows a template-based reporting system using Handlebars-style helpers (`appmap_title`, `appmap_url`) to generate consistent output formatting.

The execution is quite fast (under 5ms total) and demonstrates a well-structured reporting pipeline for tracking AppMap changes between code revisions.
