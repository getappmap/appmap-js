This PlantUML sequence diagram shows an AppMap trace of a report generation process, specifically for comparing reports. Here are the key observations:

## Main Flow
The diagram traces a `generateDetails` method call that takes 4.72ms total execution time. The process involves:

1. **Preprocessing setup** - Building a `RemovedAppMapsPreprocessor` 
2. **Context building** - Gathering data and helpers needed for report generation
3. **Title generation** - Creating AppMap titles with a loop that runs twice
4. **URL generation** - Building AppMap URLs using helper functions

## Notable Patterns

**Self-calls dominance**: Most of the method calls are self-referential (`compare_report->compare_report`), suggesting this is a class with many internal helper methods rather than a distributed system.

**Helper method usage**: The code makes heavy use of utility functions (marked with `<u>` for underlined):
- `buildPreprocessor`
- `helpers` 
- `urlHelpers`
- `appmap_title`
- `appmap_url`
- `buildUrlString`

**Performance characteristics**: The execution times are quite fast (microseconds to low milliseconds), indicating this is likely a lightweight report generation process rather than heavy data processing.

**Loop processing**: There's a 2-iteration loop for `recorderName` calls, suggesting the system processes multiple recorders or data sources.

The diagram appears to show a well-structured report generation system with clear separation of concerns between preprocessing, context building, and output formatting.
