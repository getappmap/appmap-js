This AppMap shows a test execution for the `collectLocationContext` function, which appears to be part of a code analysis or documentation system. Here are the key observations:

## What the test does

The test validates that `collectLocationContext` correctly handles file locations, including files outside the designated source directories when they're explicitly specified. It processes three files:
- `file1.js:1-1` (relative path with line range)
- `/src/file2.js` (absolute path in source directory)
- `/other/file3.js` (absolute path outside source directories, but explicitly allowed)

## Notable patterns

1. **Location parsing and normalization**: The system carefully parses file locations, handling both relative and absolute paths, and extracting line ranges when specified.

2. **Content restriction checking**: For each file, the system checks if access is restricted using `ContentRestrictions.safeRestricted()`. All files pass these checks (return `false` for restricted).

3. **Snippet extraction**: The `Location.snippet()` method is called for each file to extract relevant content, though in this test all files return the same mock content "file contents".

4. **Explicit file inclusion**: The key behavior being tested is that `/other/file3.js` is included even though it's outside the source directories (`/src`, `/lib`) because it's in the `explicitFiles` list.

## Performance note

The execution is very fast (total ~11ms), with most individual operations taking microseconds. The content restriction checks are particularly efficient, suggesting good caching or optimization.

This appears to be testing a feature that allows developers to include specific files in code analysis even when they fall outside the normal source directory boundaries.
