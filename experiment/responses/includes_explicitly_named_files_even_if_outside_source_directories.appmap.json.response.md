This AppMap shows the execution trace of a test case for the `collectLocationContext` function, which appears to be part of a code analysis or explanation system. Here are the key observations:

## Test Scenario
The test is validating that "explicitly named files are included even if outside source directories." It processes three file locations:
- `file1.js:1-1` (with line range)
- `/src/file2.js` (absolute path)
- `/other/file3.js` (outside source directories)

## Key Behavior Patterns

**Location Parsing**: The system parses location strings into `Location` objects, handling both relative paths with line ranges (`file1.js:1-1`) and absolute paths (`/src/file2.js`).

**Content Restrictions**: There's extensive use of `ContentRestrictions` to check if files should be restricted based on their location. Notably, all restriction checks return `false`, indicating the system is allowing access to all files in this test scenario.

**Multi-directory Processing**: The function processes files against multiple source directories (`/src`, `/lib`) and handles files outside these directories (`/other/file3.js`).

## Notable Aspects

1. **Repetitive Pattern**: The same `Location` object (`file1.js`) is processed multiple times against different source directories, suggesting the system tries to find files in multiple locations.

2. **Content Snippets**: Each location generates a snippet from "file contents", indicating this is likely part of a code explanation or documentation system.

3. **Explicit File Handling**: The test specifically validates that files outside source directories (`/other/file3.js`) are still included when explicitly specified, which is an important edge case for code analysis tools.

The execution is efficient (total ~11ms) and follows a clear pattern of parse → validate → extract content for each location.
