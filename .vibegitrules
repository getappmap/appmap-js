Use a tag prefix without a module in parentheses; keep the commit message 
subject short and simple (up to 60 chars); capitalize the first word after prefix,
but do not capitalize the prefix (keep it all-lower-case).

Use commit descriptions, explaining the change and especially any tricky bits.
Wrap the descriptions at line length 80.

Here's an example of a good commit message:

    fix: Patch pkg to avoid a race condition when creating directories

    Replace custom recursive directory creation with built-in recursive mkdir in
    node addon loading.

    When multiple packaged applications try to start simultaneously, they can
    encounter race conditions when creating temporary directories for loading native
    node addons. This manifests as an "EEXIST" error when calling `mkdirSync()`.

    The issue occurs in the native module loading code path where pkg needs to
    extract native addons to a temporary location before they can be loaded via
    `process.dlopen()`. The current implementation uses a custom
    `createDirRecursively()` function that has a race condition - it checks if a
    directory exists and then tries to create it, but another process could create
    the directory between the check and creation.

    Node.js has built-in support for recursive directory creation via the
    `recursive: true` option in `mkdirSync()`. This handles race conditions properly
    - if the directory already exists, it will not throw an error. This is exactly
    what we need.
